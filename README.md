# Regression_AI
A mess of a project I did for a class that uses generation evolution to create a equation to model cryptocurrency prices

Dear Lord you actually opened it... I wish you the best as it is quite the mess. For instance, there are 3 C# projects all inside each other and only one of the projects is the right one the others are random code. If you find the file that actually has the AI at least its commented.  Good luck.

Also, you should know there are some python files in there, don't worry about those. They are for the price collection and data scraping.
